# Whatwat
Whatwat is a fun side project I built while learning generative AI. You enter a short bio-age, job, interestsâ€”and it turns you into the main character of a sci-fi novel.  It uses GPT to generate a title and dramatic story blurb, then creates an AI-generated book cover based on your persona.
